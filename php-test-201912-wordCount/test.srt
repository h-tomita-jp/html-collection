People of Kattegat,
all hail your new King!

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,134
I want to take Kattegat
back from Ivar.

4
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:13,221
-You have no army.
-King Harald has.

5
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:17,099
Bjorn Ironside, fate has brought
us back together again.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,018
We should attack Kattegat,
all together.

7
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:23,480
The Gods have marked you out.
Above all men.

8
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,398
You know very well
you are not a god.

-Bjorn Ironside has claimed you.
-No man will ever claim me.

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,029
Don't you ever dream,
King Harald?

They are the enemy!

In Ragnar's time, everyone was free.
He never forced them to worship him.

Thora is dead.
Ivar burned her alive.

19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,146

to ask you to attack Ivar

20
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,606
and overthrow him
as King of Kattegat.

21

I don't like it.

[Vigrid]
They're just mercenaries.

I wouldn't trust them

51

Well, then,
maybe you should do it.

-People of Kattegat...
-[men hoot]

I told you that
when I became King,

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,393
my rule would be very different
from that of Ivar's.

[cheering]

00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,983
Ivar built a wall
around our town.

63
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,777
He discouraged foreigners,
outlawed free speech

64

and dissent
amongst our own people.

[men chattering]

Kattegat can only survive and
grow prosperous through trade,

not conquest.
That is my belief.

[Hvitserk] I know
who they are.

00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,283
All of these men collaborated
willingly with Ivar's regime.

80
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,120
They served as his bodyguards.

81

They did his bidding,
whatever that was.

However cruel,
however depraved.

83

They did it
without compunction,

84
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,755
without a thought
even for their own families.

85
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:50,802
They burned alive those who were
brave enough to stand against them.

86
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,014
And they burned alive
a young woman

00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,391
called Thora,

88
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,268
who I loved.

These men are all guilty.

103
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,870
They committed crimes against
their own people, against you.

104
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:01,206
[all] Yeah!

105
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,124
And I know you all think
they deserve to die.

106
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,461
[all] Yeah!

107
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,381
But there's something far
worse than death, far worse.

108
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:12,176
I will banish them for life.

109
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,470
They will become outlaws,
Skogarmaors,

110
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,348
men of the forests,

111
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,057
forever condemned to live
in the forest

112
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,811
and other deserted places.

113
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:24,979
Their property
will be confiscated.

114
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,855
They will be branded
as Skogarmaors,

115
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:29,024
and they can be killed
with impunity.

116
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:30,318
This is much worse than death.

117
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:34,321
They will live not as human
beings, but as ghosts.

118

Outside of human society.

Everyday forced to regret
and remember their decisions

120
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,913
and their crimes,

121
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,710
yet unable to atone for them.

122
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,461

All in favor, say "Aye."

[all laughing]

336
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,887
A god?

337
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:36,347
Yes. A true god!

338
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:38,393
Revealed to the world
at Kattegat!

339
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,978
We're Christians now.

340
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,731
But we still have some strong
memories of the old gods.

341
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:46,776
We still, perhaps,
some fear of them.

342
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,029
So, if he's a god,

343
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,866
why was he traveling through
my kingdom in disguise?

344
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,536
What are his real intentions?

345
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,413
I can't help being suspicious.

346
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,500
I need to know.

347
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,794
You can imagine my desire,
can't you?

348

[grunts]

349
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,761
Please, you had
better to tell me,

350
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,763
my friend.

351
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:19,517
There's nothing left to say!

We have had some problems
with your friend.

357
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,481
He was not cooperative,
not helpful.

[groans]

359

I don't understand.

What has he done wrong?

361
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:18,784
Your friend refused to tell us

362
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,912
why you had really come here,

363
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,747
to my kingdom,
in disguise.

[groaning]

365
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:29,921
I already told you
there was no reason.

366
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,173
[laughs] There is always
a reason!

Always.

Maybe.

[Lagertha]
You were right, Torvi.

380
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:47,642
This is where
I shall build my farm.

381
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,060
This is where I shall

382
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:52,855
live out the rest
of my days.

383

-We will help you to build it.
-Hmm.

384
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,402
We will not sail anywhere

385
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,613
until your new farm house
is built and you're settled.

386
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,704
I would need some livestock.

387
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:11,914
Not much, a few goats,

388
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:14,501
a pig maybe,
a horse to pull the plow.

389
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,337
[Hali] Are you really
going to live here, Lagertha?

-Yes.
-[Asa] All on your own?

391

Probably.

392
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:23,970
Won't you be lonely?

393
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,262
[Lagertha chuckles]

394
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:29,348
No, Hali, I won't be lonely.

395
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:34,980
Because I will be visited by Grandfather
Ragnar and a lot of other friendly ghosts.

396
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,488
I also have some news.

397
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,740
You don't need to tell me.

398

You are with child.

399

00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,250

[Oleg in English]
What do you think?

404
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,602
Would you like to fly,
Ivar, the Boneless?

405
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,270
-I don't understand. -[chuckles]
There is nothing to understand.

406
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,526
Once we get enough speed,
we will be free of the earth.

407
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,612
Isn't that the dream
of all humans?

-I don't know.
-[Oleg chuckles]

409

Surely for you,
who cannot walk.

00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,496
Who can only crawl
across this earth.

411
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,332
The thought of flying free
as a bird above it,

412
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,335
must be exciting, huh?

-[exhales deeply]
-Why?

429

Because you're a god.

It's true, isn't it?

431
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,360
You are a direct
descendant of Odin.

432

revealed as a god.

You're not a god!

King Bjorn, Queen Gunnhild,

00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,026
we bring news of King Harald.

454
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,533
We were led to believe that King
Harald had died of his wounds.

455
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,368
No. It's true he was wounded
in the battle,

456
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:02,123
but King Olaf rescued him
and took him back home.

457
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,292
Well, that was indeed noble
of King Olaf.

458
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,377
[messenger 1]
Perhaps not so much.

459
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:11,214
While King Harald was sick,
King Olaf claimed his kingdom.

460
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,760
And had enough warriors
to enforce his claim.

461
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,181
[Bjorn] Well, that is a pity.

462
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,016
What has it got to do with me?

463
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,102
[messenger 2] King Harald
is still recovering his health,

464
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,563
but he does not want
to be ruled by King Olaf.

465
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,193
He knows his life is threatened
and likely to be forfeit.

466
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,694
He also remembers that
he came willingly to your aid

467
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:36,199
when you desired to attack
your brother Ivar.

468
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:39,408
And that he personally
saved you

469
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,621
when Ivar tried to capture
and kill you.

470
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,123
Therefore, he claims
an obligation.

471
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,167
He asks you

472
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,709
as a true Viking,

473
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,506
as a son of Ragnar, as a
friend and ally, to help him

474
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,132
overthrow the usurper.

475
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,096
[Gunnhild] I'm sure we are very
sorry for King Harald's plight.

476
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,933
But I am not sure we are
under any obligation to him.

477
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,475
On the contrary,

478
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:06,977
King Harald believes that you
have become true friends.

479
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:09,106
Whatever's happened between
you in the past.

480
00:35:10,148 --> 00:35:11,916
He could've pressed his
claim to the kingship

481
00:35:11,928 --> 00:35:13,360
of all Norway when
he had the power.

482
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,613
And he could've pressed
his claim to marry you,

483
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,114
Queen Gunnhild.

484
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,500
As a man of honor,
he did neither.

485
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,335
But now, King Bjorn,

486
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:32,963
he reaches out to you

487
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,090
as another man...

488
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,387
Man of honor for your help.

489
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,099
We heard that you had become
King of Kattegat.

490
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:47,353
So the real question is,

491
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,233
what kind of a King
are you going to be?

492
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,030
[chuckles]

493
00:35:59,072 --> 00:36:00,240
I will think on it.

494
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,465
[Oleg] I have something
to show you.

495
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:26,224
[Ivar] What is this place?

496
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,936
[Oleg] A mausoleum
of my dead wife.

497
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,233
The most sacred place
in the palace.

498
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,322
And the most sacred place
in my heart.

499
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:45,286
How did she die?

500
00:36:49,414 --> 00:36:50,458
I killed her.

501
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,170
She was young and foolish.

502
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:57,965
I discovered that she was
sleeping with one of my aides.

503
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,677
I loved her.

504
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,389
She was enchanting.

505
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,231
I thought of her all the time.

506
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,947
[sniffles]

507
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,909
Even on the battlefield.

508
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:28,244
Yet,

509
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,206
all that time,

510
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,920
in some sordid room
here in the palace,

511
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,715
she was secretly betraying me.

512
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:47,097
I know your pain.

513
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,360
Then you know all about
the fickleness of women.

514
00:38:05,865 --> 00:38:08,077
I somehow knew
you would understand.

515
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,456
I don't bring many people
down here.

516
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:19,338
But you...

517
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,844
I think you and I

518
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,806
are going to have
a very special relationship.

519
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:35,186
I truly think so.

520
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,179
[instrumental music playing]

00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,139

522
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,827
[grunting]

523
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,826
As the sun sets,

524
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:16,538
and in the sight of the gods,

525
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,416
I swear, I will fight no more.

526
00:40:21,668 --> 00:40:23,045
Forever.

527
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,909
[chattering]

528
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:59,623
Those messengers
disturbed me today.

529
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,708
I know.

530
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:05,211
I did not expect it.

531
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,594
It was when they asked me what
kind of King I was expected to be,

532
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:15,972
I thought I'd answered that.

533
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:19,059
I thought I knew.

534
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:23,856
When I spoke to the people,
I spoke from the heart.

535
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,943
I thought it was my answer.

536
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,155
I'm sure it was your answer.

537
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,949
Those messengers,
those unknown men,

538
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:37,619
they spoke to something deeper.

539
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,540
I'm sure they did not know it, and King
Harald secretly commissioned them.

540
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,126
I know that, but still...

541
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,128
You are confusing things.

542
00:41:46,628 --> 00:41:48,462
Whether or not you go
to the aid of King Harald

543
00:41:48,463 --> 00:41:50,256
will not define
what you are as a King.

544
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,925
Then what will define it?

545
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,594
Perhaps your differences
from your father.

546
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,972
Or my similarity.

547
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:01,518
He was still loved.

548
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,440
You must be yourself.

549
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,027
I want to be myself,
I'm just not sure how to be.

550
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:18,077
After all, doing the right thing
might just be the easy way.

551
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:20,746
That is always the danger,

552
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:24,083
to do the right things
for the wrong reasons.

553
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:28,503
You are so right
to be cautious.

554
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,016
When I look out
into the Great Hall,

555
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,102
I see my father and my mother.

556
00:42:45,103 --> 00:42:46,188
Why wouldn't I?

557
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:53,612
And suddenly, I feel old.

558
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,867
I'm not their son any longer.

559
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:02,829
I'm your husband.

560
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:06,083
A father.

561
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:10,878
And I am a King.

562
00:43:21,597 --> 00:43:22,641
[sniffing]

563
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:28,146
I have decided to treat
your arrival here

564
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,982
as a sign,

565
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,150
an omen.

566
00:43:35,737 --> 00:43:38,363
You see,
for a long time, we Rus,

567
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:40,658
guided by my brother-in-law
King Rurik,

568
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,579
looked to the east for trade,
conquests, and expansion.

569
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:48,208
Yet, even before your,

570
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,170
I admit,
somewhat unexpected appearance,

571
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:56,007
I had begun to question
this way of thinking.

572
00:43:57,842 --> 00:43:59,469
Perhaps, after all,

573
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,474
it's time for us to look west

574
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,434
again.

575
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,606
Years ago, I hung my shield on the
city gates of Constantinople,

576
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,778
but now it's time to hang it
on the gates of Kattegat.

577
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,199
Our ancestral
and original home.

578
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:24,577
And you can help me.

579
00:44:26,704 --> 00:44:28,497
And be revenged

580
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:31,335
upon your brothers
at the same time.

581
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,135
I say it is a fine plan.

582
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,390
Now I see that my arrival
here in Kiev was no accident,

583
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,018
as I supposed,
but all arranged by the gods.

584
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:51,813
How could it be otherwise?

585
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,273
The gods.

586
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:56,902
Let us drink to

587
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:58,903
Odin.

588
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:00,530
[chuckles]

589
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:02,906
To Odin.
